Introduction to Programming in Java, or CPSC1060, is one of the first CS courses that students take at Clemson University. This course is designed to introduce students to the Java programming language, as well as the basic concepts of programming and problem-solving using programming methodologies. This course is a pre-requisite for many other courses in the Computer Science department, and is one potential option for CS students and non-CS students looking to satisfy their general education requirements.

The official course page is hosted through Canvas, which only students currently enrolled in CPSC1060 will have access to. If you're curious as to what some of the coursework looks like in this class, you're welcome to email me at my university email mjre[at]clemson[dot]edu.
