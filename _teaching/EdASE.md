EdASE, or "Educating Autistic Software Engineers," is an annual online summer camp hosted by the [Human Factors of Software Engineering (HFSE)](http://clemsonhfse.com/). Every summer, the HFSE research lab hosts this summer camp for high school students on the autism spectrum to expose them to high-level video game design, giving them the unique opportunity to code their own video games from scratch and network with peers.

I worked with EdASE for two years, and it was an amazing opportunity to work with neurodiverse students who all shared a common interest in video game design with me. If you're at all interested in this camp, either because you know somebody who might be interested in enrolling in the camp, or you're interested in potentially working with or supporting the camp, you can find more information here on the [EdASE website](https://edase.org/).
