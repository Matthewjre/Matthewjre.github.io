Intro to Software Engineering, or CPSC2150, is the first course undergraduates take in the Software Engineering path we have at Clemson. In this course, students are intoduced and become familarized with some of the most common and best practices of every-day software development, like how to use GitHub, abstraction of code, and unit testing.

The official course page is hosted through Canvas, which only currently enrolled students of CPSC2150 will have access to. If you're curious as to what some of the coursework looks like in this class, you're welcome to email me at my university email mjre[at]clemson[dot]edu.
